# Building a TrustGraph app with Claude Code

There's no code here, here's a transcript.  Note that a lot of Claude
output has been trimmed.

## Transcript

Create a React application in this directory.  Use:
- Typescript
- Vite

This might work:
npx --yes create-vite . --template react-ts

```
  Done. The React TypeScript application has been created. To get started, run:

  npm install
  npm run dev
```

Downgrade to React 18

```
  Done. React and related type definitions have been downgraded to version
  18 in package.json.
```

Install @trustgraph/react-state and read the README.

```
  Package installed and README reviewed. The @trustgraph/react-state package
  provides React hooks for TrustGraph applications with TanStack Query hooks,
  Zustand stores, and a pluggable notification system.
```

Update vite.config.ts to proxy to the TrustGraph websocket in line with
the README you just read.

```
  Done. The WebSocket proxy has been configured to forward /api/socket to
  ws://localhost:8088/api/v1/socket.
```

Now replace the React app placeholder page with a real application:

Chat Interface: Build a classic conversational UI with:
- A scrollable message list displaying the conversation history
- User messages displayed on the right side in blue
- Agent responses displayed on the left side in dark gray
- Auto-scrolling to the latest message
- An input field for message entry at the bottom
- A "Send" button that also responds to the Enter/Return key
- Loading state showing "Sending..." on the button while processing
- Disabled input during message submission

Use the TrustGraph GraphRAG service to provide messages.  Use
collection 'default' flow 'default'.  Operate as user 'trustgraph'.

```
‚óè Chat interface complete. The application now includes:

  - Provider setup with TanStack Query, NotificationProvider, and SocketProvider
  - ChatInterface component with scrollable message list
  - User messages (right, blue) and AI responses (left, dark gray)
  - Auto-scrolling to latest messages
  - Input field with Send button
  - Enter key support for sending messages
  - Loading state ("Sending...") while processing
  - Disabled input during submission
  - TrustGraph GraphRAG integration with collection 'default', flow
    'default', user 'trustgraph'
```

{note: code doesn't work at this point}

Run npm build and fix any problems

```
  src/App.tsx(3,32): error TS1484: 'NotificationHandler' is a type and must
    be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is
    enabled.
  src/ChatInterface.tsx(15,55): error TS2339: Property 'clearInput' does not
    exist on type 'ConversationState'.
  src/ChatInterface.tsx(23,57): error TS2339: Property 'isSubmitting' does
    not exist on type 'ConversationState'.
  src/ChatInterface.tsx(24,60): error TS2339: Property 'setIsSubmitting' does
    not exist on type 'ConversationState'.
```

{at this point the app builds and runs}

It overflows the screen top and bottom, can you fix? 

```
  Fixed. Updated App.css and index.css to remove padding/margins and set
  proper overflow handling so the chat interface fits exactly within the
  viewport.
```
